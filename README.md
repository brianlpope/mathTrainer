===========
This is a program that includes 5 types of math quizes: multiplication, addition, subtraction, division, and sequences.  It will allow a user to test their skills and shows them their correct and incorrect scores as well as the amount of time taken to complete the quiz.  The initial version does not allow the user to set the highest numbers used for the questions, but that is planned for the near future.
